.NET-Speed-Library
==================

A library of simple, common tasks written in C# (and C++) that are specifically tuned for speed. These 
functions are faster than the .NET framework equivalents. In some instances if the conditions are just
right when the .NET framework is faster, the functions will sue those instead.

This is just an initial release and it only has one public function so far. More will be added soon.
